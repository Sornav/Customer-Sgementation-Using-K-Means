# Customer-Sgementation-Using-K-Means
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering on the "Mall_Customers" data set which I got from Kaggle,visualized and analyzed my data by using Plotly Library and used the SK learn K-Means Library as  well my own implemented K-Means Function to Cluster the Customers into K groups.The optimal number of groups K was found out by using the classic elbow method,lastly compared the Sk-Learn generated result with the result of my own method,the result was pretty accurate.

**Important***** 


**Note:I usually visualize my data by using Plotly Library,so if you are having trouble viewing them in the GitHub viewer, you are free to clone my repository on your local machine and check them out in jupyter notebook.
